# Simple Shell
## Overview

### This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. Completing this project will involve using the UNIX fork(), execve(), and waitpid() system calls and can be completed on Linux system.
### A shell interface gives the user a prompt, after which the next command is entered. The example below illustrates the prompt and the userâ€™s next command: ls simple_shell.c (This command displays the file simple_shell.c on the terminal using the UNIX ls command.)
### One technique for implementing a shell interface is to have the parent process first read what the user enters on the command line (in this case, ls simple_shell.c) and then create a separate child process that performs the command. Unless otherwise specified, the parent process waits for the child to exit before continuing. However, UNIX shells typically also allow the child process to run in the background, or concurrently by using the wait() or waitpid() command.
## Synopsis
- This program is designed to implement the similar system calls and errors of the original Shell program and was created using C89. Our sample shell cannot handle 
arguments. Any argument added to a command will not be considered and only the
basic command will be executed (see example). Our simple shell can be exited using 
the exit command or by using Ctrl+D. The simple shell can handle simple commands 
with the full path (e.g. /bin/pwd) or with the command only.
## List of Files used in Program
- check_status.c
- check_path.c
- check_built_in.c
- execute_command.c
- path_append.c
- tokenizer.c
- free_tokens.c
## Requirements
	Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)
	Bash or any other compatible shell
---
## Description
	This is a simple shell script that demonstrates how to prompt the user for 
	input and allow the user to execute commands.
---
## Usage
	Open a terminal.
	Navigate to the directory where the script is located.  
	Run the script interactively using the following command:
	./hsh
	And non interactively using 'echo "ls" | ./hsh
---
## GCC Compiler
	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
---
## Example (shell cannot handle arguments)
	$ ls -l

	check_path.c      free_tokens.c      push           simple_shell.c
	$ ls
